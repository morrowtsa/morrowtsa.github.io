					<h1>Augmented Reality Technologies</h1>
					<p>Take out your phones right now and open up your favorite, interactive app: Pokemon Go. As you are walking around your neighborhood and swiping your screens to capture your Pokemons, realize that in your hand, you are holding one of the best, most advanced technologies today: augmented reality. Augmented reality (AR) is an emerging technological advancement that allows digital graphics to be displayed in real time.  Today, we use AR for a myriad of purposes and we will continue to use it for a more entertaining and interactive future!</p>

					<h1><b>Uses, Technologies, and Benefits</b></h1>
						<h3><b>As of current, augmented reality technologies serves a purpose in either of the three categories:</b>:</h3>
							<p><b>1.</b>	As A 3D viewer – These type of technologies places 3D models in a person’s real world, in real-time. For example, an interior designer could have an empty room with plain walls and an unfurnished area. With the help of augmented reality technology, the interior designer can place life-size furniture, painted walls, and so on, serving as a guide to get the job done. This is done with or without the use of trackers, which are single images that 3D models can cling on to in augmented reality. To refer to the previous example, a black dot can be stuck in certain locations where the designer wants to place furniture. The augmented technology would know the black dot indicates a place of furniture, and the designer can try to see which types of furniture would best fit the room!</p>
							<p><b>2.</b>	As a browser – The use of augmented reality technologies in this form allow one to gain contextual information about a specific geographical location or real object. With this, smartphones with cameras, GPS, and compass sensors are needed. Such an example is when a New Yorker can point to a city street and gain information about subway routes and times.</p>
							<p><b>3.</b>	As a game – These types of technologies allow the user to have an immersive gaming experience by fully utilizing his/her surroundings. It is a great way to have the user very engaged in the game, as it allows for a fun and memorable experience. Thus, more and more gaming companies have been attracted to the use of augmented reality technologies. A great, and perhaps the most popular, example of augmented reality gaming is Pokemon Go. In addition to allowing users to interact with their real world, users also enjoyed their exchanges with their own communities and people. </p>
						<h3><b>Current Technologies:</b></h3>
							<h4><b>Current Displays:</b></h4>
								<p>-	Head mounted displays are worn on the head or attached to some type of hat or helmet. HMDs are similar to the look of goggles, much like VR gaming systems (Oculus).</p>
								<p>-	Handheld devices are the most practical, which includes someone’s laptop or smartphone.</p>
								<p>-	Spatial display allows for graphic pictures to be projected on fixed surfaces.</p>
							<h4><b>Current Applications:</b></h4>
								<p>-	Sightseeing has been enhanced with augmented reality. Using a smartphone, tourists can simply point to a historic or cultural site and see facts pop up on their very phone about the place. In addition, augmented reality systems are used to enhance the experience of museum attendees. Total Immersion, a global-recognized business in AR, has interactive kiosks in museums that allow guests to interact with museum displays in 3D. </p>
								<p>-	Military uses AR primarily in two ways: Heads-Up Display (HUD) and Head-Mounted Display (HMD. HUDS are used for military pilots and provide data, such as altitude and airspeed. The HMDs are used for ground troops, who are provided crucial data like enemy location.   </p>
								<p>-	AR has been a booming application in the medical field. Visualizations allow for an in-depth view of actual medical situations, such as practicing surgery. AR can actually reduce the risk of an operation, as it provides the surgeon better sensory perception. </p>
						<h3><b>Benefits:</b></h3>
							<h4><b>AR is an innovative and new application in entertainment. AR games are constantly being used in marketing campaigns, to attract new and old customers</b></h4>
								<p>1.	A great number of occupations (designers, architects, and so on) will have their jobs made easier and quicker. A lot of jobs call on for visions—a set idea in mind for a certain product.  With AR, these tasks are made easier as the computer algorithm in AR can produce that realistic vision for them! With that, these workers can choose whether or not to go ahead with that idea or alter it. </p>
								<p>2.	 AR is perfect for virality. Consumers are attracted to foreign features—things that they believe are advanced for today’s age. For example, Pokemon Go exploded through social sharing; users loved the idea of using AR and interacting with their surroundings. There is less competition with AR, because there are very few products that actively incorporate it. </p>
								<p>3.	AR increases user engagement and interaction with the surroundings. This can best benefit students, who can be learn more about historical and cultural locations when they are augmented. An example of this would be pointing your smartphone towards Martin Luther King Jr.’s birth home in Atlanta, and a user could see an entire background and history of that single location. </p>
						<h3><b>Concerns:</b></h3>
							<p>-	AR can be a distraction. Any augmented reality display places a popup in a person’s view, whether it be on their phone, car dashboard, glasses, and so on. The underlying point is that it covers up one’s main way of vision, and this can impair their visual perception. While using augmented reality, a user is vulnerable to a great deal of hazards, according to AR skeptics.  </p>
							<p>-	AR users fear for their privacy. For example, Google launched a pair of AR glasses that can read emails, provide GPS directions, what one looks at on a daily basis, and so on. Users of these are scared that glasses are pushing the boundaries of privacy, as Google has full knowledge of a person’s location, where they are and what they look at, and has the potential to obtain a lot other private information. </p>

					<h1>Our Solution</h1>
					<p>A powerful feature of Pokemon Go, a current augmented reality game, is that it detects when a device is moving too fast, such as going on a road. As a way to stop users from playing the game while driving, the game stops working. As a solution, we propose a pair of augmented reality glasses. It sounds simple and done before, but these pair of glasses will include features that ensure safety. Similarly to Pokemon Go, when the glasses detect fast movement, it will cease from having popups that could distract the user’s vision. The glasses function for a myriad of purposes, but specifically those that require immediate reaction that can be seen through one’s eyes. For example, tourists look at foreign signs and do not understand what it’s saying, or residents look at subway information and doesn’t know what time it comes.  Therefore, The glasses can take place of technologies that require a smartphone. For example, instead of pointing a smartphone towards a sign in a foreign language, the user can simply face towards the sign and have a translation pop up.
