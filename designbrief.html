                    <h2>Introduction to UAS Technology</h2>
                    <p>
                    Unmanned aerial systems (UAS), also known as drones are aircrafts without a human pilot aboard. Drones can be used to make deliveries and take photos. They can be flown by being either preprogrammed or remotely controlled.

                    <h2>Uses of Drones</h2>
                    
                        <h3>Commercial</h3> 
                            <p>In today’s world, drones have helped out several business and companies alike in their delivery services. Notably, Amazon has announced their plans to use drones is Amazon, and is planning to launch “Amazon Prime Air” in the near future. Amazon Prime Air is set to be their future delivery system, promising that consumers may receive their items in just minutes. Another commercial use drones have been used in is photography. Drones with cameras attached are able to take pictures of landscapes and sights from skyscraping heights, quite impossible to do with just a regular camera. Today, there are drone-based photography services that provide customers with aerial shots. </p>
            
                        <h3>Educational</h3> 
                            <p>As of recent, drones have been common to use in the classroom. An emerging field, geospatial technology, relies heavily on GIS/GPS for mapping. Thus, the use of drones in social studies is a great way for students to photograph and record their geographic setting. Obvious fields that drones can take part in include robotics, engineering, physics, and construction. Learning the electrical systems and functions of different mechanics are all concepts drones can be used to teach.</p> 
            
                        <h3>Research</h3> 
                            <p>Drones have contributed a great amount to rescue missions, wildlife research, and agriculture monitoring. Using drones has become an increasingly popular way for biologists to observe wildlife animals in their habitats in hard to reach areas, such as birds, orangutans, and so on. This seems to be an attractive option, as drones are less expensive, easy to use, and provide top-notch results and data. A large number of farmers can benefit from using drones as they can inspect their crops more carefully, see any flood damage, and look out for barren spots. The University of California-Davis, for example, uses drones for crop dusting.</p>

						<h2>Current Drone Technology</h2>
							<p>First and foremost, drones differentiate from remote control helicopters in the way that the can fly without input from a pilot. Drones most commonly come with a detachable battery that provide 12 minutes of flight time; drone makers have created batteries with up to 25 minutes of flight time. The more battery power, the more the weight. Thus, because drones must be light, they are unable to hover for long periods of time in one setting. </p>
				
							<p>All drones must have a controller. These controllers correlate to the drone activity by using radio waves. According to Michael Perry, public relations major at drone-creator DJI, stated that UAVs are run by 2.4 gigahertz radio waves. Most drone controllers use Wi-Fi to communicate with the actual aircraft, and this can be broadcasted on the 2.4 gigahertz spectrum.  When the drone is in flight, their onboard sensors keep the aircraft in the air. There is an altimeter inside, and this tells the operator what altitude the UAV is at. When the operator wants to stay at a certain height, the onboard sensors will do so.</p>

						<h2>Safety and Privacy concerns</h2>
							<p>The greatest safety concerns stem from the fact that drones interfere with helicopters, airplanes, and other aerial transportation. There have been numerous accounts of close collisions between airplanes and drones at airports already. The FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) states they receive more than one hundred reports of such collisions every month. Larger UAVs, such as those that patrol borders and those used by the police, pose the biggest threat: the greater the size, the greater impending damage if a collision was to happen. Though they do not pose that great of problem, smaller drones are dangerous as well. Collisions with a small UAV can result in expensive consequences, such as breaking/damaging windscreens, engines, and much more. </p>
				
							<p>More and more people are sending complaints that drones are intruding their privacy. The FAA normally just regulates amateur and commercial drone activity; however, the FAA does not regulate privacy. Hobbyists enjoy the leisure of being barely regulated, and it is these drones that are more commonly reported. There have been police complaints of drones hovering over places where they should not be: private property, peoples’ homes, and so on. All around the nation, homeowners fear that random UAVs are potentially spying on them and invading their privacy.</p>
				
							<p>In an attempt to reduce both safety and privacy concerns, the FAA has implemented several codes and rules that have to be met before even purchasing/using a drone. For instance, as a response to drone and plane collisions at airports, the FAA has made it illegal to fly a UAV within five miles of an airport. As a response to collision damages, unmanned aircrafts have to weigh less than fifty-five pounds. Other regulations include a maximum airspeed of 100mph, maximum altitude of 500 feet above ground level, visual line-of-sight only, and daylight operations only. </p>

						<h2>Near Future Advances</h2>
							<p>As stated in the commercial uses of UAVs, more and more companies are expected to launch drones for delivery purposes. It is reported that a drone can support up to five pounds, and this yields a myriad of items that are able to be delivered. According to Amazon, 84% of their orders are under five pounds. 75% of UPS deliveries are also under give pounds, meaning that over 3 million packages could be delivered by drone. Humans would not have to work the same load. Tons of money will be saved. Most importantly, pizza can be delivered! </p>
				
							<p>Search and rescue missions will be relieved of work by using a drone that could get to difficult to reach points a human never could. Drones could also be used as tour guides, such as in museums, colleges, attractions, and more. MIT, for example, have already built drones to help new students around their campus.</p>

						<p style="font-size:15px;"><i>"This past summer (2015), I was given the opportunity to 	attend Georgia State University's Urban Atlanta STEM Academy, which revolved around geospatial technology. The program lasted a week, and I remember that Wednesday was the most memorable. All of the 30 participants were given the chance to fly a drone over Piedmont Park. We could only go up to 50 feet and could record videos of the view, or our peers below. 
						<br/>
						It was so fun. In my hands, I was controlling a piece of such advanced technology. When I wanted it to stay aloft at the same technology, I didn't press anything and it stood in the air. I spun it and moved it around and around, and the footage I captured was breathtaking! I could only drive it around for a minute though, as it was 10 of us in a group and everyone needed a turn. Overall, flying a drone was a great experience. I can definitely see it as a 	fun hobby."
