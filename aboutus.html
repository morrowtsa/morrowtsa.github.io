	<p>Every year, Morrow TSA holds a canned food drive to give to underprivileged families, just in time for Thanksgiving. This year, our chapter was able to raise 75 cans to give away! The homeless department was overwhelmed with the massive amount; they were so happy to accept all our donations.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Since the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society are Georgia TSA&#39;s state partner, our chapter takes part in the annual Pennies for Patients fundraiser. This fundraising lasted for a month. We set a goal, and our members EXCEEDED it! We are so proud of all members that participated and can&#39;t until next year to set an even higher goal!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Our community&#39;s assisted living home holds an end-of-the-year celebration to wish on the new year. The event is always its biggest, with a photobooth, snack bars, and its grand &quot;balloon drop&quot;! 10 of our members helped around with the event, and they can all say they had a great time.</p>
