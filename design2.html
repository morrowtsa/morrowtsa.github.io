                <h3>Educational</h3>
                    <p>We supply artificially intelligent robots to schools in order to help teach young kids emerging computer science at an early age. By no means is this on the same level as a machine learning course at a top university, but it does begin to build computer science related skills such as coding, logic, and debugging at a much earlier age than most are exposed to now. If you are a school official looking for an opportunity to add on to your technology program, this is the right choice for you!</a></p>
                    
                    <h3>Commercial</h3>
                        <p>Perhaps you are a warehouse manager, looking for a way to automate some tasks that generally require more than just a few rudimentary executions. This makes it hard to replace some workers in order to help your budget and expand the company. However, we have industrial grade robots that can be programmed to learn in any environment for YOUR specific needs. If you are looking for a commercially ready product, this is for you!</p>
                    
                    
                </div>  
        
                
                    <div class="col-md-7">
                
                        
                        
                <h3>Recreational</h3>
                        <p>If you enjoy programming, robotics or are looking to get into artificial intelligence on your own for personal use, then we have a product that fits you perfectly. Program this robot to learn in a home environment. Need a ping pong partner? It can learn that (and maybe even beat you in a few hours)! Need a general house keeper it can also learn many cleaning excercises. As you progress and teach it new things, it grows and learns, becoming better at every task you set it to. Soon, it’ll be mowing the lawn and trimming the hedges!
                        </p>
                    
                    <h3>Research</h3>
                        <p>Perhaps you are looking for an AI that can aid you in analyzing protein folds to find connections to diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Don’t worry, we have you covered without research-oriented robot. This version of our AI robot comes equipped with powerful hardware capable of much more than your typical workstation computer, and unlike supercomputers, it can move around doing any task it needs to do during research. How do you think it would react to stimuli differently than humans? You can test that thanks to its robotic capabilities. Try doing that on your average desktop!</p>
